Overview <br/>
The project involves analyzing two datasets using various machine learning algorithms to achieve specific predictive goals.The models were evaluated based on their performance metrics. Detailed results and analysis can be found in the respective sections of the project report.

Datasets<br/>
1. NASA Nearest Earth Objects (NEO) Dataset<br/>
The objective is to predict whether a near-Earth object is hazardous based on its physical and orbital characteristics.<br/>
Key Features: Estimated diameter, relative velocity, miss distance, and hazardous status.<br/>
2. Banking Marketing Targets Dataset<br/>
The goal is to predict whether a client will subscribe to a term deposit based on their demographic and historical data.<br/>
Key Features: Age, job, marital status, education, last contact duration, and subscription status of term deposits.<br/>
